<h2>Shooting Targets is Fun!</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Beat the clock to shoot all the targets on stage
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
A fun, easy experience that lets the player easily accomplish their task, but still gives them a small challenge to motivate.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Platformer/Shooter
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The player controls the small, orange dragon to jump across the purple platforms in an attempt to shoot all the targets before the clock runs out! The core mechanic is shooting and jumping and the combination of the two. The player can move with the arrow keys, jump with the up-key, and shoot with the spacebar. One difference that could have been included was varying velocities of your fire breath which could have been controlled by the player. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
A combination of shooting and jumping to hit a specific target.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
While it is close to other platformers in mechanic, the combined challenge of shooting and jumping to destroy targets in a small time limit is unique to my game. It can be taken further and could be made more challenging as well.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The main character in the game, Jeff the orange dinosaur, lives in a world where the occupants are judged on how quickly they can destroy  targets on a stage. Every dinosaur in this world of destroying targets must become adept at this skill or risk being ostracized by the rest of the dinosaur community.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
Jeff the dinosaur sets out on a quest to destroy a set of targets as fast as he can to prove to himself and his peers that he is capable and skilled.  Recently, his father, who watches him from above in Shooting Targets is Fun, passed away and it motivates Jeff to do justice to his father's memory. It's almost as if he can hear his father saying from the clouds "Believe in yourself"...
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Children, young teens, people who like small, orange dinosaurs that resemble a beloved franchised character.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
Less than a minute to 2 minutes.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Analyzing the stage before setting off to destroy the targets to assure the best path is taken to maximize time efficiency. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Prototype assets were taken from: http://phaser.io/examples/v2/audio/sound-complete

The sound effects and sprites were taken from phasers repository except for the song which was from:

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
It resembles the Destroy the Targets minigame in Smash Brothers (but you can shoot in my game) and uses source code from several phaser games, but most notably http://phaser.io/examples/v2/arcade-physics/platformer-tight.
